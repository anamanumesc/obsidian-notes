 My plans with this project

1. i want it to be an open source website
2. so anyone can contribue to writing code
3. but it has to be secure. public but secure 
4. i want to amke a cicd pipeline to help me accept new contributions from people that wanna contribue to my open source code
5. i want it to be cheap to run
6. i want it to run on aws.
7. i want it to be used by people to make book xchanges
8. but because i wont promote it, it wont be very popular so even if it has a few numbers of users its ok.
