| A **device or IP address** on that network that knows how to forward packets _beyond_ the local subnet. |


- it has an ip address
- basically when u wanna reach smth outside of the LAN, you first reach the gateway. 
- in my house the gateway is the router
- a "a door between networks"
- a firewall or load balancer can take the role of a gateway
- ip 
- adress next-hop address the packets are sent to




“This destination is reachable **directly**, without needing a gateway.”
**On-link route** → destination is in the same subnet as one of your interfaces.
